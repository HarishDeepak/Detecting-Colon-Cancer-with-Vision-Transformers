# Detecting Colon Cancer with Vision Transformers and Explainable AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a method for detecting colon cancer using Vision Transformers (ViT) and explainable AI techniques. Vision Transformers are employed to classify histopathology images, with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) used to highlight cancerous regions. This method is compared to traditional 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Colon cancer, a cancer of the large intestine, often begins as benign growths called polyps. Early detection through histopathology, the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is critical for effective treatment.

## Features
- Leverages Vision Transformers (ViT) for histopathology image classification.
- Applies GradCAM for visual explanations of model predictions.
- Compares performance against traditional 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Preprocesses histopathology images to enhance model accuracy.

## Performance
The project evaluates and compares the performance of the Vision Transformer and 2D CNN models, with the ViT model achieving notable accuracy in detecting colon cancer.
